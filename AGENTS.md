# Repository Guidelines

## Development

- Start the dev server with `pnpm dev`.
- Run tests with `pnpm test`.

## Linting and Formatting

- Code style is enforced with **ESLint** and **Prettier**.
- Execute `pnpm lint` to check formatting and lint the codebase.

## Branching and Commits

- Create feature branches from `main`.
- Use **Conventional Commits** for commit messages (e.g. `feat: add login page`).

Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before submitting a pull request.
